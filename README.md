# Esp-radio personal fork
Project based on [Edzelf esp-radio project](https://github.com/Edzelf/Esp-radio).
This fork refactors the code to a more readable and maintainable code (while keeping playback without hiccups).
It also removes MQTT and iHeartRadio functionalities, and uses a I2C display instead of a TFT one.
Wiring hints on ino file.
